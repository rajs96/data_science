# Occupancy Classification
Here, we work with a dataset used to classify whether or not a room is occupied. The dataset has five features: Temperature,
Humidity, Light, C02, and Humidity Ratio. Our goal is to test how accurate our model is when we implement logistic regression
from scratch, using gradient descent. Then, we will compare this to the accuracy achieved when we use sklearn's Logistic Regression.
